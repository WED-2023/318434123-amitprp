 "Bleach", is a popular manga and anime series created by Tite Kubo.
 the story of Bleach revolves around the afterlife realm of spirits, known as the "Soul Society" or "World of the Souls." Ichigo Kurosaki, the main character, becomes a Soul Reaper, tasked with protecting the Soul Society and battling evil spirits known as "Hollows".

**GenryÅ«sai Shigekuni Yamamoto** is a central character in Bleach. He serves as the Captain-Commander of the Gotei 13, the organization of elite Soul Reapers. Yamamoto is revered for his immense power, leadership, and strict adherence to duty and discipline. He is often depicted as a stern and formidable figure, earning nicknames like "The Almighty" and "The Old Man Yama."

In the website created, I utilized several techniques to enhance the user experience:

Utilization of unordered lists: The website organized content in a structured and clear manner using <ul> and <li> tags. For example, in the "About" page, lists were used to highlight various characteristics of Yamamoto.

Incorporation of GIFs for visuals: GIF images were used to add visual effects and enhance the site's appeal. This incorporates with the "vibe" of Yamamoto, as his powers rely on fire and destruction.

Implementation of a like button that saves likes to local storage: For the "Like" button, functionality was created using JS, allowing users to click the button and add a like to a variable representing the number of likes. This variable consists of data stored in the browser's local storage, so users can see the number of likes they've added even when refreshing the page.
