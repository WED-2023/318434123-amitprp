            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              <br/> <b>Overview</b> <br/>
              Genryūsai Shigekuni Yamamoto is a prominent character in Tite Kubo's manga and anime series Bleach. As the founder and Captain-Commander of the Gotei 13, Yamamoto is one of the oldest and most powerful Shinigami (Soul Reapers) in existence.
              
              <br/> <b>Appearance</b> <br/>
              Yamamoto is characterized by his advanced age, marked by a long white beard and numerous wrinkles. Despite his elderly appearance, he possesses a formidable physical build, indicative of his immense strength and combat prowess. His attire is the standard Shinigami captain's uniform, complemented by a white haori, signifying his rank as Captain-Commander.
              
              <br/> <b>Personality</b> <br/>
              Yamamoto embodies the ideals of honor, duty, and discipline. He is a stern and authoritative leader, often perceived as rigid and uncompromising. However, beneath this stern exterior lies a deep sense of responsibility and a protective nature toward the Soul Society and its inhabitants. His decades of experience have made him a wise and strategic leader.
              
              <br/> <b>Powers and Abilities</b> <br/>
              Yamamoto's power is unrivaled among the Shinigami. His Zanpakutō, Ryūjin Jakka, is the oldest and most powerful fire-type Zanpakutō. Its abilities include:
              
              <b>Shikai</b>: Ryūjin Jakka - Upon releasing its Shikai, Ryūjin Jakka engulfs the surrounding area in intense flames that can incinerate anything in their path. Yamamoto controls these flames with precision, using them for both offense and defense.
              <b>Bankai</b>: Zanka no Tachi - Yamamoto's Bankai is even more devastating. It condenses all the flames of Ryūjin Jakka into the blade, making it incredibly hot and powerful. The Bankai has several techniques, each showcasing the devastating power of fire and heat, capable of turning everything to ash.
              <br/> <b>Role in the Story</b> <br/>
              Yamamoto plays a crucial role throughout the series, especially during major arcs involving the Soul Society. Key moments include:
              
              Soul Society Arc: Yamamoto oversees the operations and maintains order among the captains as the Ryoka (Ichigo and his friends) invade the Soul Society to rescue Rukia Kuchiki. His authority and combat skills are highlighted during this arc.
              Arrancar and Fake Karakura Town Arcs: Yamamoto leads the defense against Aizen's army, displaying his strategic acumen and combat prowess.
              Thousand-Year Blood War Arc: This arc delves deeper into Yamamoto's past, revealing his history with Yhwach and the Quincy. His leadership and strength are put to the ultimate test as he faces the most formidable threat the Soul Society has ever encountered.
              <br/> <b>Legacy</b> <br/>
              Yamamoto's influence extends beyond his lifetime, with his actions and decisions shaping the course of the Soul Society's future. He is remembered as a symbol of strength, resilience, and unwavering dedication to his duty.

                <h3>Three Major Differences Between Web1, Web2, and Web3:</h3>
                <p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <b>Web1:</b> <br/>
                      
                      Static Content: Web1, also known as the "Static Web," primarily consists of static web pages that are read-only. Content is delivered from the server to the client without any user interaction or dynamic content generation.
                      Limited Interactivity: There is very limited user interaction. Users can only view and read the content, but they cannot interact with it in meaningful ways. There are no social features like comments, likes, or user accounts.
                      Decentralized Content Creation: Content is created and published by a small number of content creators. There is no platform for users to generate or share their own content easily.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Web2:</b> <br/>
                    
                      Dynamic Content: Web2, known as the "Social Web," allows for dynamic content that changes based on user interaction. Examples include social media platforms, blogs, and e-commerce sites.
                      High Interactivity: Users can interact with websites through forms, comments, likes, shares, and other social features. User-generated content is a significant aspect of Web2, with platforms like Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter.
                      Centralized Platforms: Web2 is characterized by centralized services and platforms that control user data. Companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon host and manage vast amounts of user data and content.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Web3:</b> <br/>
                    
                      Decentralized Content and Services: Web3, often referred to as the "Decentralized Web," aims to eliminate centralized control by using blockchain technology. Content and services are distributed across a network of nodes.
                      Enhanced Security and Privacy: Web3 emphasizes privacy and security through cryptographic techniques. Users have control over their own data and can interact with applications anonymously.
                      Smart Contracts and dApps: Web3 introduces smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) that run on blockchain networks like Ethereum. These applications operate autonomously without the need for a central authority.

                <h3>Differences Illustrated by a Use Case: "Side Effects of Medications"</h3>
                <p>
                  Scenario: A user searches for "side effects of medications." <br/>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <b>Web1:</b> <br/>
                      
                      Experience: The user visits static web pages that list information about medication side effects. These pages are like online brochures or encyclopedias, providing read-only content without any interaction. For example, the user might find an article on a medical website that lists side effects for a specific drug.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Web2:</b> <br/>
                      
                      Experience: The user receives search results from dynamic and interactive websites. They might visit a forum where other users have shared their experiences with the medication, read blog posts from healthcare professionals, or watch a video on YouTube discussing side effects. They can leave comments, ask questions, or join discussions on social media platforms.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Web3:</b> <br/>

                      Experience: The user uses a decentralized application (dApp) to search for medication side effects. This dApp accesses data from multiple decentralized sources, ensuring privacy and security. The information might come from a blockchain-based health records system where patients have shared their anonymized experiences with different medications. The user can trust that the data is tamper-proof and has not been altered by any central authority. Additionally, the user might use a smart contract to anonymously query a network of medical professionals for insights or to verify the information.\
